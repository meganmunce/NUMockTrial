      <h3>What is college mock trial?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="mback">
      <p>College mock trial is a competitive public speaking ability governed by the American Mock Trial Association. Students compete as both attorneys and witnesses, giving speeches, acting as characters, and engaging in impromptu objection battles. </p>
      <p>We compete against other colleges across the country in front of real lawyers and judges using rules based on the federal rules of evidence. Each year, we try a new case. This year, the case is about an alleged poisoning. To learn more about mock trial and this year's case, come to an info session!</p>

      <h3>Why should I join NUMT?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="eback">
      <p>NUMT has a history of success. We're one of only three programs in the country to qualify multiple teams to nationals for two years in a row, and in both of those year's we've finished in the top 10 teams nationally. Being on NUMT will directly prepare you for a myriad of careers, such as our recent alumni that have gone on to Harvard Law, the Washington Post, and even software development!</p>
      <p>But more than just a competitive team, we're a tight knit community. Many of our seniors say the best part of being on mock trial wasn't just the critical thinking and public speaking skills they gained, but also the lifelong friends.</p>

  <h3>Do I need experience or to be prelaw to join?</h3>
</div>
<div class="fback">
  <p>No to both!</p>
  <p>While NUMT is a great way to learn more about the legal profession, each year we have members from every single undergraduate school - including Bienen and McCormick! The critical thinking, public speaking, and writing skills you'll gain through mock trial can be used in any career or major.</p>
  <p>You also don't need any experience at all. Over half of our members come to our team without any experience in mock trial, many with no experience in public speaking at all. We pride ourselves on being a program that can teach the earliest beginners to be successful competitors in their first year.</p>

  <h3>What is the tryout process like?</h3>
</div>
<div class="jback">
  <p>There are three parts to the tryout:</p>
  <p>1. A short interview where we'll ask you questions to get to know you!</p>
  <p>2. A 1-2 minute speech about the case where you'll show us your public speaking and argumentation skills.</p>
  <p>3. A question and answer section where you'll pretend to answer questions as one of the witnesses from the case.</p>
  <p>Everything you'll need for your tryout will be explained and sent out during the info session.</p>

  <h3>What will mock trial look like during COVID-19?</h3>
</div>
<div class="kback">
  <p>We'll be doing everything we normally do - from attending the same amount to tournaments to still having fun bonding activities for our new members - just over Zoom.</p>
  <p>All of our tournaments will take place over Zoom, and we're planning fun social events as well such as cooking competitions and virtual coffee dates to help welcome our new members to our team and to Northwestern!</p>
  <p>Our team also has a technology fund to help any member afford any technology or formal clothing they might need to participate in mock trial so that finance is never a barrier to participation.</p>
